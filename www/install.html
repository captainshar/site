    <h2>Caveat Emptor</h2>

    <p>
        That's Latin for "cover your butt." This is brand new, not secure, and by not means production ready.
        I've worked in Magnetics, Electrical, Software, Site Reliability, and Infrastructure Engineering.  
        There are many methods used here I would NEVER use in a real environment at a real company.
        Eventually, we can lock things down with certs and what not, but for now, consider this experimental.
    </p>

    <div class="uk-alert uk-alert-danger">
        <p>Always be careful downloading and installing other people's code. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="uk-alert uk-alert-warning">
        <p>Only do this at home on a secure network. </p>

    <div class="uk-alert uk-alert-success">
        <p>Make sure you try in the face of failure, having fun along the way.</p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            At minimum you'll need two Raspberry Pi's, probably the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/">3B+</a>.
            <ul>
                <li>Maybe it'll work with others?  I just haven't tried.</li>
                <li>If you want to do more stuff, use like 3 or 4.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            You'll also need to be able to wire a Raspberry Pi to your network, ethernet style.
            <ul>
                <li>This is just for setup, and you only have to do it one at a time.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Process</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Download the <a href="https://klot-io.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/pi-0.1.img">pi-0.1.img</a> and burn it into an SD card. 
            <ol>
                <li>I'm fond of <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/memory-cards/microsdhc-evo-select-memory-card-w--adapter-32gb--2017-model--mb-me32ga-am/">Samsung's EVO Select 32Gb</a> cards but use whatever you like. </li>
                <li>I'm not an expert in which cards perform best or whatever.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Power Up
            <ol>
                <li>Insert SD card into Pi.  Wire to your network (ethernet cable). Power up.</li>
                <li>Wait a minute or so as the OS expands the filesystem. </li>
                <li>Get impatient and go to <a href="http://klot-io.local/">http://klot-io.local/</a> anyway, understanding it might not come up right away.</li>
                <li>The site will recognize it has default settings and automatically log you in with the password 'kloudofthings'.</li>
                <li>Oh btw, you're logging into your new Pi right now.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Configure Master
            <ol>
                <li>Set a new password. This'll be both for the GUI/API you're using and the pi account on the Pi (make sure it's like 8 chars long).</li>
                <li>Decide whether to enable SSH or leave it disabled.  It's up to you, and you can change later through this page.</li>
                <li>Enter the WiFi settings for your network or leave it as is to stay wired.</li>
                <li>Set the role to Master for this first one and give your cluster a name, lowercase, no spaces (I should have something check that and password too). </li>
                <li>Click Config.  You should now have to log in with your new password.</li>
                <li>Note the site URL changed to (cluster)-klot-io.local. This is the hostname of the Master now and will be your home base going forward.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            Join Workers
            <ol>
                <li>Once the status is Master, burn another SD card, and plug it into a new Pi, wire to the network, and power up.</li>
                <li>Head over the Nodes page. After a few minutes, a Node called "klot-io" willl appear.  That's your new Node.</li>
                <li>To have it join as a Worker with the same settings as the Master save the name, give it a name and click Join. </li>
                <li>To have it join as a Worker with different settings, click it's name and Config on its own site.</li>
                <li>Back at the Master's Nodes, page, wait 20 seconds or so, and it'll appear in the Node listing as (name)-(cluster)-klot-io.local</li>
                <li>Repeat for as many Workers as needed.  Just make sure each name is unique (ya, should probably write something to check this too). </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        Congrats!  You have a Kubrernetes Cluster on Raspberry Pi's!
        Hit up <a href="{{=DRApp.link('apps')}}">Apps</a> for what's next.
    </p>

    <h2>Advanced</h2>

    <p>
        There's some other ways to install that are a little more secure and a little more involved.
        Head over to <a href="{{=DRApp.link('development')}}">Development</a> for more. 
    </p>

    <h2>Culus Faciem Tuam</h2>

    <p>
        Ok, that's the real Latin phrase for "cover your butt."
        And please, don't think I'm good at Latin.
        I took a year in college, but I totally used Google translate for this bit.
        I ain't gonna front.
    </p>
